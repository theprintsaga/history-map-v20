At its peak stands Jupiter, wielder of thunder and guardian of law, whose will shaped the fate of Rome. Beside him is Minerva, goddess of wisdom and warcraft, patron of strategy and intellect. And in the tales of Hercules, strength and endurance shine through twelve trials that mirror the virtues of Roman perseverance. These stories, born of borrowed myths and molded by Roman might, breathe through marble statues, sacred temples, and the eternal fire of the Vestals. It is a mythology of discipline and destiny, where the gods walk with legions and the stars shine on empire.",
